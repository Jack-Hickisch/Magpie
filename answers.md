I ACCIDENTALLY PUT SOME OF THE ANSWERS TO THIS EXERCISE ON THE LAST EXERCISE SO THAY IS WHERE THEY ARE


How does it respond to “where do you come from”? - 
 I am originally from London. Now I live in here, in your computer. Where are you?

What is the most interesting response? -
I only hear that type of response less than five percent of the time.

What is the most peculiar response? -
Tomato.

How does it respond to “asdfghjkl;”? -
What time is it there?

Can you identify keywords to which your chatbot responds? - 
Afrirmation words like; yes, correct, right, of course 
Negation words like; no, not, incorrect, wrong
Question words like; what, how, can, why, who, where

Think of several keywords and the responses they might cause. - 
hi || hello || Hi || Hello || sup || what's up etc.

My mother and I talked last night. -
Tell me more about your family

I said no! -
Why so negitive?

The weather is nice. -
Hmmm.

Do you know my brother? -
Why so negitive?

Keyword          Response
pie              I like pi more than pie
where            I am not knowledgable with the location of things
keyboard         I wish I could type but I can only respond

What happens when more than one keyword appears in a string? Consider the string “My
mother has a dog but no cat.” Explain how to prioritize responses in the reply method.

The response would be set to the first "else if" to run, you could prioritize responces by puting the keywords in order of priority.

What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know
all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the
responses to these statements. - 
When the code sees keywords as part of a larger statment it resopnds like it would as if that word was by itself. This could be solved by including spaces in the keywords like: " no " isnstead of "no".

What value is returned by indexOf if the substring does not occur in the string?

-1

To ensure that you understand it, trace the following
method calls. 

// can't do the table here so I did this

1
psn = 9
before = " "
after = ""'

// that would be it

2
psn = -1
before = probably and error
after = "B"

// that would be it

3
psn = 9
before = " "
after = "c"

psn = 19
before = " "
after = "s"

// that would be it 

4
psn = 3
before = "k"
after = "w"

psn = 7
before = " "
after = "t"

psn = 22
before = "s"
after = "w"
